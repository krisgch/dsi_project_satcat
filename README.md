### Problem statement

Standardized tests have become more and more unreliable as technology progresses. With new college majors emerging every year and new skillsets being more and more demanded in the market, standardized tests no longer measures the potential of students. As a student representative, I was given the opportunity to plead my case with University/College board members on why the one-year trial of 'test optional' admission policy should be extended and expanded to Universities all over the US.

### Background
The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges:
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from students' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). 
- Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. 
- Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.
